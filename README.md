There are two parts to this repository.

## Part 1: Grand Canonical Basin Hopping
Geng Sun, a former postdoc in Prof. Philippe Sautet's lab, developed this part of the code. This performs a global optimization on the system in consideration based on the input modifiers. An example of how to implement this code is given in the gcbh_example directory.

## Part 2: Codes to Study Grain Boundaries of Silicon
All of the code is available in pipelines.py. The following are the available features:
1. cell_opt: Optimizes the size of the simulation cell.
2. axis_opt: Optimizes the
